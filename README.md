# **Enjoy this LIRI App!**

This language interpretation and recognition interface (LIRI) was built to answer four different prompts:

### :musical_note: Concert-This:
Ask Liri "node liri.js concert-this "YOUR CHOSEN BAND" and it will tell you when/where your favorite bands are playing.  Might even help you figure out where to vacation next - even if it's a virtual vacation (#wanderlust).

### :musical_score: Spotify-this-song:
Ask Liri "node liri.js spotify-this-song "SONG NAME" and you should get a quick snippet of the song in your browser, and the album you can find the song.  Have fun with it - there are loads of songs out there.

### :movie_camera: Movie-this:
Ask Liri "node liri.js movie-this "A GOOD MOVIE" and find out key facts about a movie. Should include the year it came out, the IMDB & Rotten Tomatoes rating, country where it was produced, language of the movie, plot, and the key actors.  Feel free to movie-this a few of my favorites:  Romancing the Stone, Elf, A Few Good Men.  Or you can let LIRI decide for you and leave the movie name out.

### :crystal_ball: Do-what-it-says
Ask Liri "node liri.js do-what-it-says and wait for what she wants to tell you. :grin:
